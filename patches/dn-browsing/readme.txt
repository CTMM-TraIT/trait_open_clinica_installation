Contains the fixed java files for OC-6757 / OC-5697 and TraIT1509 330

Another change was proposed by Joe Keremian which is better than the one initially proposed 
by TraIT. We are going ahead with Joe his fix. The modified files are included here because 
this is not yet included in the verison we are currently using (3.6).


On 05-02-2016 another problem was fixed (TraIT1512 147) by changing DiscrepancyNoteDao:250.
